Cache uses the GNU Autoconf system for configuration and building

To generate the configure script:
autoreconf -if

If autoreconf complains about libtool problems... run libtoolize first
libtoolize

You will need to compile and install ADTs (simple abstract data types)
and srpc (simple RPC service).  These can be found in
   https://github.com/jsventek/ADTs
   https://github.com/jsventek/SRPC
respectively.  Install these (make; make install) BEFORE the
configuration step below, 
so that the generated Makefile will include references to the
libraries in the CC command line (-lADTs -lsrpc).  If you get an error
message from the linker about not finding functions in the ADTs
package, it is likely because these libraries were not present when
Cache was configured. 

After generating the configure script,
./configure --help
will list configuration options.


After successfully completing an execution of the configure script, Makefiles will be generated in the correct directories and make can be used to build and install the software.
make clean
make
make install
